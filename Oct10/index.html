<h3>Bolt! Mobile Gaming Drives Home Gatorade's Message To Teens</h3>
<div class="video">
<script height="450px" width="800px" src="http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=dcc84e41db014454b08662a766057e2b&ec=RjZHc3azoolt8xAPxcvDvLAqKBkBc7gB"></script></div>
<p><strong>TRANSCRIPT:</strong></p><br />
<p>You know, as we were doing research for Gatorade, we found that even elite athletes sometimes eat pizza and drink soda in between practices, despite their coach's pleas for them to be smarter about what they consume.  So if they do it, is it any surprise that even the best teen athletes do it too?</p><br />
<p>We also found teen athletes often chose to drink water during practice because they thought it provided the proper hydration they needed.</p><br />
<p>So we came up with an entertaining and competitive way to reinforce to teens that consuming Gatorade would help them <strong>perform better on the field</strong> and that water was the enemy of performance.</p><br />
<p>Working with a game developer, we integrated Gatorade into Bolt!, a mobile game featuring Usain Bolt, Gatorade athlete and the fastest man in the world. The integration needed to position Gatorade as the hero helping drive better performance and higher scores with water as the enemy that hinders performance.</p><br />
<p>The objective was to maneuver Usain's character through a course in the fastest time possible, gathering Gatorade along the way to make him go faster and avoiding drops of water that slow him down.</p><br />
<p>Gatorade social media center, mission control, harnessed 4 million online fans and a network of influential celebrities to generate buzz around the game, including Usain himself, Troy Polamalu and Justin Bieber.</p><br />
<p>Bieber:  "The last app I downloaded it's called Bolt ... it's pretty cool."</p><br />
<p>This earned and owned exposure generated strong results and a happy client with <strong>no paid media supporting the campaign</strong>. The game was <strong>downloaded almost 2.5 million times, played 87 million times with almost 75% of the players falling into Gatorade's key 13 to 24 year old demographic.</strong></p><br />
<p>More importantly though, <strong>the 820 million brand impressions generated</strong>, drove home the message that Gatorade helps you perform better than water.</p><br />

<h3>So... what happened to Ads?</h3>

<div class="clerks"><h1>III.<br />Disruption.</h1></div>

<h3>What Is A Newspaper?</h3>
<h3>A Brief history of Advertising &amp; Journalism</h3>
<p>1833: Bejamin Day launches The Sun, a New York City newspaper that sold for a penny, a sixth of what his competitors charged. Other newspapers relied on selling the newspaper itself. Day focused on winning the circulation war. To the victor went the advertisements. (We'll come back to that.)</p><br />
<p>Day's lead editorial: "The object of this paper is to lay before the public, at a price within the means of every one, ALL THE NEWS OF THE DAY, and at the same time <strong>afford an advantageous medium for advertising</strong>."</p><br />
<p>1835: James Gordon Bennett publishes The New York Herald. He also priced his paper at a penny an issue, but his lead editorial read: "<strong>We shall support no party</strong>--be the organ of no faction or coterie, and care nothing for any election or candidate from president on down to constable."</p><br />
<p>To be independent, the Herald needed to make more money from advertisers. Bennett saw ads as content in the newspaper, so he wanted them to also be new every day. He also required his advertisers to pay in advance, which quickly became the industry standard.</p><br />

<p>1896: Adolph Ochs buys The New York Times. In constrast to senational newspapers of the day, he emphasized objectivity and hard news. He still sold it for a penny.</p></br />

<p>The 20th Century: Newspaper companies become media companies. They buy radio stations, TV stations, education companies, each other.</p><br />
<p>1990s: The Internet goes mainstream. Newspapers start putting their content online, for free, assuming they could sell more ads online.</p><br />
<p>2000: The dot-com bubble bursts. Craigslist is spreading.</p></br />
<p>2008: Newspaper revenue craters. I graduate from journalism school.</p><br />

<h3>Clayton M. Christensen's<br />Theory Of Disruptive Innovation</h3>
<p>The nut shell: When a company excels at doing the same thing long enough, someone will figure out how to do that thing better.</p><br />
<p>The nut: Consumers buy products to do a job, possibly more than one. If a new product will accomplish that job more efficiently, consumers will switch to that product.</p><br />

<h3>A funny thing happens when you advertise online...</h3>
<div class="clerks"><h1>IV.<br />Parasites.</h1></div>
<h3>...advertisers find out that their ads<br />aren't doing much good.</h3>
<p>The first banner ad:</p>

<p>Newspapers always sold ads on the promise that all of their readers their entire circulation would see them. They promised a lot, and they delivered very little.</p><br />
<p>When ads went online, advertisers could finally find out how many people saw their ads.</p><br />
<h3>Two Quick Words About "Metrics"</h3>
<p>They suck.</p>
<h3>Some More Words About "Metrics"</h3>
<p>In the 1830s newspapers slashed their prices and focused on sensational news to boost their circulations and charge more for ads.</p><br />
<p>Today this is called "optimization." The Huffington Post was famous for Search Engine Optimization (SEO), writing headlines designed to get higher results in Google (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110206142750/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/05/what-time-superbowl-start_n_819173.html">"What Time Does The Superbowl Start?"</a>). When Google started tweaking their search algorithms, this became less successful.</p><br />
<p>Today, websites like <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> and <a href="http://www.upworthy.com/">Upworthy</a> and <a href="http://www.viralnova.com/">Viral Nova</a> use Social Optimzation, headlines and content that that was designed to be shared online.</p><br />
<h3>Who's Getting All Those Ad Dollars?</h3>

<h3>Churnalism</h3>
<p>The act of recycling press releases, pulling out quotes or statistics without attributing their sources. <a href="http://churnalism.sunlightfoundation.com/">A website created by the Sunlight Foundation</a> (there's also <a href="http://churnalism.com/">a British version</a>) can help identify it.</p><br />
<p>The term comes from a line in "Flat Earth News," by Nick Davies, a reporter for The Guardian:</p><br />
<p>"Journalists who are no longer gathering news but are reduced instead to passive processors of whatever material comes their way, <strong>churn</strong>ing out stories, whether real event or PR artifice, important or trivial, true or false."</p>
<h3>It's Not Just Print Media</h3>
<p>Many companies use Video News Releases (VNR). These are pre-packaged segments that tout a certain product or service, often dressed up as news stories.</p><br /><br />

<p>This segment was released in 2004. The closing words are "In Washington, I'm Karen Ryan reporting." Karen Ryan was a PR specialist hired by the Department of Health and Human Services, not a reporter. </p><br /><br />

<h3>A New Problem on the Web: Sourcing</h3>
<p>Most of the news you read on blogs started its life somewhere else. The editor might add a "source" link at the bottom, but that usually only goes to where they found, not the "original source"</p>
<div class="clerks"><h1>V.<br />Paradiso.</h1></div>
<h3>Advertising Can Be Important</h3>
<a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/documented-rights/exhibit/section4/detail/heed-rising-voices-transcript.html"><img src="http://www.seitzwrites.com/Oct10/images/Sullivan.jpg" /></a>
<p>In 1960, The New York Times ran this full-page ad. It was placed by a group of civil rights activists decrying their treatment in the South. They charged that the police of Montgomery, Alabama had committed "grave misconduct." The police commissioner of Montgomery, L.B. Sullivan, sued The New York Times, for libel. The Times lost the first case, and the appeal, but the case eventually made it to the Supreme Court.</p><br />
<p>The Court's ruling in Times vs. Sullivan established that libel can only be committed against public figures if there is "actual malice." It is one of two most important court rulings regarding journalism of the past century.</p><br />
<p>And it started with an ad.</p>
