				<h2>Other Points of Interest</h2>
					<p>For guests who will be spending some extra time in town, there is plenty to do in Boston and the North Shore:</p>
					<p>The wedding will be held on Halloween weekend, so there will be <a href="http://hauntedhappenings.org/">lots going on</a> in <strong>Salem</strong>. For those arriving on Friday night who would prefer to avoid the accompanying traffic, we recommend taking I-93 North from Logan Airport and taking I-495 North to Amesbury.</p>
					<p>The neighboring town of <strong>Newburyport</strong> has a number of restaurants and boutiques, as well as a beautiful view of the Merrimack River.</p> 
					<p>First-time visitors venturing into <strong>Boston</strong> should see Boston Common and the Public Gardens, or walk down Newbury Street in the city's Back Bay neighborhood.</p>
					<p>If you'd you like to stop off in <strong>Somerville</strong>, you can also visit Prospect Hill Park, where the first American flag was raised during the Revolutionary War. It's also the place where Jon proposed, and where Cristine said yes.</p>
