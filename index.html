<h1>Jonathan Seitz</h1>
<h2>Journalism/Design/Photography</h2>
<p>I'm a multimedia journalist, originally from Southwest Florida but currently living in Somerville, Mass. By day I'm the researcher/reporter for Nieman Reports, the quarterly magazine of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, and in the other hours I'm an amateur photographer, aspiring designer, and occasional guitarist.</p>
<p>I'm interested in creating things and creative problem solving. I've taken apart every guitar I've ever owned (and put them all back together) and spent countless hours reading about ways to hack my gear because I'm always trying to solve or improve on some problem that's driving me crazy.</p>
